						As far back as I can remember, I 
                         always wanted to be a gangster.
                         To me, being a gangster was better 
                         than being President of the United 
                         States.
                         Even before I first wandered into 
                         the cabstand for an after-school 
                         job, I knew I wanted to be a part 
                         of them. It was there I belonged.
                         To me it meant being somebody in a 
                         neighborhood full of nobodies.
                         They weren't like anyone else. 
                         They did whatever they wanted. 
                         They'd double-park in front of the 
                         hydrant and nobody ever gave them 
                         a ticket.  In the summer when they 
                         played cards all night, nobody 
                         ever called the cops.
                         Tuddy Vario ran the cabstand and a 
                         pizzeria and a few other places 
                         for his brother, Paul, who was the 
                         boss over everybody in the 
                         neighborhood.
                         Paulie might have moved slow, but 
                         it was only because he didn't have
