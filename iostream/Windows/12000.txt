               FADE IN:

               JUNE 11, 1970S  QUEENS, NEW YORK. THE SUITE - NIGHT

               A smoky, overdecorated cocktail lounge and nightclub on 
               Queens Boulevard. Sergio Franchi is in full voice on the 
               jukebox.  It is after midnight.  It has bean a long night.. 
               Balloons and empty glasses litter the place.  BILLY BATTS, 
               a 50-year-old hood in an out-of-date suit, court at the 
               bar. WE SEE a younger, more sharply-dressed HOOD walk in 
               with a BEEHIVE GIRLFRIEND and hug BATTS.

                                     HOOD
                         Billy. You look beautiful. Welcome 
                         home.

                                     BAITS
                              (laughing and turning 
                              to the bartender)
                         What are you having? Give 'em what 
                         they're drinking.

               WE SEE FOUR OTHER MEN, including HENRY HILL and JIMMY BURKE, 
               standing near BILLY BATTS at the bar, raise their glasses 
               in salute. TOMMY DESIMONE and ANOTHER BEEHIVE BLONDE enter. 
               BILLY BATTS looks up and sees TOMMY.

                                     BILLY
                         Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew 
                         up.

                                     TOMMY
                              (preening a little)
                         Billy, how are you?

                                     BILLY
                              (smiling broadly at 
                              Tommy and the girl)
                         Son of a bitch. Get over here.

               TOMMY walks over and BILLY, too aggressively, grabs TOMMY 
               around the neck.  TOMMY doesn't like it.

                                     TOMMY
                              (forcing a laugh)
                         Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.

                                     BILLY
                              (squeezing Tommy's 
                              cheek, a little 
                              too hard)
                         Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," 
                         he says.  A little pisser I've 
                         known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, 
                         don't go get too big.

                                     TOMMY
                         Don't go busting my balls. Okay?

                                     BILLY
                              (laughing, to the 
                              crowd at the bar)
                         Busting his balls?
                              (to Tommy)
                         If I was busting your balls, I'd 
                         send you home for your shine box.

               TOMMY'S smile turns to a glare as he realizes BILLY is 
               making fun of him. The Men at the bar are roaring with 
               laughter.  His GIRL is looking glumly at her shoes.

                                     BILLY
                              (to the hoods at 
                              the bar)
                         You remember Tommy's shines? The 
                         kid was great.  He made mirrors.

                                     TOMMY
                              (almost a threat)
                         No more shines, Billy.

                                     BILLY
                         Come ooonnn. Tommeeee. We're only 
                         kidding. You can't take a joke? 
                         Come ooonn.

               WE SEE that TOMMY is still angry, but begins to relax with 
               BILLY'S apparent apology, but as soon as BILLY sees that 
               TOMMY is beginning to relax, he contemptuously turns his 
               back on TOMMY.

                                     BILLY
                              (facing the bar)
                         Now get the hell home and get your 
                         shine box.

               HENRY quickly steps in front of TOMMY who is about to 
               explode. BATTS is facing the bar and does not see just how 
               furious TOMMY has become.

                                     HENRY
                              (gently wrestling 
                              Tommy away from 
                              the bar)
                         Come on, relax. He's drunk.  He's 
                         been locked up for six years.

                                     TOMMY
                         I don't give a shit. That guy's 
                         got no right.

                                     HENRY
                         Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. 
                         Forget about it.

                                     TOMMY
                              (trying to wrestle 
                              past Henry)
                         He's insulting me. Rat bastard. 
                         He's never been any fuckin' good.

                                     HENRY
                         Tommy.  Come on. Relax.

                                     TOMMY
                              (to Henry)
                         Keep him here. I'm going for a 
                         bag.

               TOMMY roughly grabs his GIRL'S arm and storms out.

                                     HENRY
                              (rejoining Jimmy 
                              and Billy Batts at 
                              the bar)
                         Batts. I'm sorry.  Tommy gets 
                         loaded.  He doesn't mean any 
                         disrespect.

                                     BATTS
                         He's got a hot head.

               WE SEE the LAST TWO GUESTS get up to leave. HENRY puts 
               another dollar in the jukebox and moves back behind the 
               bar and starts to total the register receipts.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               From HENRY'S POV behind the bar, WE SEE the GUESTS leave 
               and suddenly WE SEE TOMMY in the doorway. HENRY walks around 
               the bar and approaches TOMMY.

               WE SEE JIMMY and BATTS are still seated at bar with their 
               backs to the door.

                                     BATTS
                         They're fucking mutts.

               WE SEE JIMMY nod.

                                     BUTTS
                         I seen them.    They walk around 
                         like big shots and they don't know 
                         shit.

                                     JIMMY
                         A guy gets half a load on.  He 
                         mouths off.

                                     BATTS
                         When I was a kid, I swear on my 
                         mother, you mouth off, you got 
                         your fucking legs broke.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               HENRY

               Approaching TOMMY who is carrying a large folded package 
               under one arm.

               TOMMY, followed by HENRY, walks over to the bar where JIMMY 
               and BILLY BATTS are talking. TOMMY drops the package on 
               the floor.

               BILLY BATTS looks up.

               JIMMY turns around and sees that TOMMY has a gun in his 
               hand.

               JIMMY immediately grabs BATTS's arms and WE SEE TOMMY smash 
               the gun into the side of BATTS's head. WE SEE TOMMY hit 
               BATTS again and again as JIMMY continues to hold BATTS's 
               arms.

                                     JIMMY
                              (to Henry, while 
                              pinning Batts's 
                              arms)
                         Quick! Lock the door.

               WE SEE TOMMY club BATTS to the ground with JIMMY holding 
               BATTS's arms.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               HENRY locking the door.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               BATTS'S INERT FORM  -

               on the floor.

               WE SEE TOMMY unfold the package he had dropped near the 
               bar.

               It is a plastic, flower-printed mattress cover.

               TOMMY and JIMMY start putting BAITS's legs into the mattress 
               cover.

               HENRY is standing over them as JIMMY and TOMMY struggle to 
               fit BAITS' s body into the mattress cover.

                                     HENRY
                         What are we going to do with him? 
                         We can't dump him in the street.

                                     JIMMY
                              (to Henry)
                         Bring the car round back. I know a 
                         place Upstate they'll never find 
                         him.

               TOMMY is looking brightly at HENRY, as he and JIMMY finally 
               zip BATTS in the mattress cover.

                                     TOMMY
                         I didn't want to get blood on your 
                         floor.

               EXT. REAR DRIVEWAY - THE SUITE - NIGHT

               Darkness. The open trunk of HENRY 's car. The mattress 
               cover is being shoved into the trunk by the THREE MEN.  It 
               is heavy work.

                                     HENRY
                         Batts's made. His whole crew is 
                         going to be looking for him. This 
                         is fucking bad.

                                     TOMMY
                         There's a shovel at my mother's.

               INT. TOMMY'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Darkness in the kitchen. We hear noise of doors opening 
               and tools being banged around in the dark.

                                     TOMMY
                         SSHHH. You'll wake 'er up.

               Suddenly the light in the entryway goes on, and WE SEE 
               TOMMY'S MOTHER, in housecoat, beaming at her SON and his 
               FRIENDS.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               where TOMMY'S MOTHER' hovers over the seated TOMMY, HENRY 
               and JIMMY. The table is filled with plates and coffee cops 
               and the debris of dirty dishes.

                                     MOTHER
                              (to all)
                         Have some more. Yon hardly touched 
                         anything. Did Tommy tell you about 
                         my painting? Look.

               WE SEE her reach next to the refrigerator and pull up a 
               couple of oil paintings she props on the edge of the table.

                                     MOTHER (CONTD)
                              (proudly)
                         They want me to do a portrait next. 
                         I'm gonna do the Moan Lisa.
